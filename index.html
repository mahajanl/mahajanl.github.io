                        The Wardrobe project was designed with those who would use it in mind; while it is a web app,
                        I thought about 1) who would use it, 2) when, and 3) why. The answers were 1) people who love their stuff,
                        2) when they weren't near their computer, but when they DO have their phone, and 3) to make their lives easier and more organized.
                        With this in mind, I kept extraneous pictures to a minumum, the fonts bold, the buttons easy to click, and the app fully responsive.

                                    I loved making this project, but it has its flaws. Looking forward, I want this to be a mobile app, since I think whoever would
                                    use this wouldn't use it on their computer. I also built in the capabilities to stretch the app to a lot of uses, like the ability to
                                    build oufits and see how the pieces would look together, and the ability to find items by the season, occasion, and color scheme.

                        Even though it doesn't involve any visuals, this was hands-down one of my very favorite projects. With this, I learned how to nest loops;
                        the ins and outs of "if" statements, and how much fun it is to create something intricate. This was also the project that taught me about inheritance,
                        abstract classes, the importance of detail when naming, and how to build a model to do one thing and one thing well.

                            During my 12 week time at We Can Code IT, this was the project that made me almost throw my laptop. Abstract classes and I finally are friends, 
                                and I also finally understand how to make and call a method properly. Now, what I'd love to do is turn it into an MVC project, complete with 
                                a database to make all the math persist throughout.

                        This project gave me massive insight into how it will be to work with a client who has a very specific plan in mind for their website. We were given
                        the mock-up and told to recreate it; which meant doing research into what each piece could potentially be, getting the HTML bones in place, 
                        and then using CSS to make every pixel perfect. I learned so very much about the whole process, and really loved the way it turned out.

                            functional website for a made-up place - like the Restaurant at the end of the Universe - and combine it with a review site I also

                    My journey into the tech world has been a long time coming, stemming from my love for ZooTycoon and the internet,
                    and culminated in my time at the We Can Code IT boot camp in Cleveland, OH. I love all aspects of building, trouble-shooting,
                    designing, and polishing projects from start to finish, and enjoy thinking of the experience a user has as they deal
                    with a piece of technology. I want to be a developer who understands human intuition.
